# xmc1100
Code for Infineon XMC1000 and XMC4000 series microcontrollers

src/
GCC compilable source code.

disassembly/
I had some trouble working out the serial port details from the manual
so I disassembled the blinky app that comes with the board.  Here's the
result.

docs/
Useful documentation from Infineon and other sources.  A good place to
start if you're planning on programming for this chip family.

scripts/
Scripts to make things easier, such as calculating serial port parameters.
