Code for Infineon XMC1000 and XMC4000 series microcontrollers

blinky/ contains examples that blink the LEDs using different peripherals.
examples/ contains examples that don't blink the LEDs.
peripherals/ contains the peripheral support code.

I find it useful to run three terminals in addition to development terminals:
1) ./JLinkGDBServer -device XMC1100-0064 -speed 4000 -if SWD
2) arm-none-eabi-gdb ('tar ext :2331')
3) minicom (connected to /dev/ttyACM0 115200, 8N1)

blinky/README has additional information on how to use gdb to load and run
programs from either SRAM or flash.
