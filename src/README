The driver program is set up to drive an ultrasonic transducer:
main.c

Peripheral support code (see the "XMC1000 Family Reference Manual" for details).
The usic code also draws from disassembly of the factory installed blinky app
on the XMC2Go kit:
ccu.c         - Capture compare unit 4.
ccu.h
gpio.c        - General purpose IO.
gpio.h
nvic.c        - Nested vectored interrupt controller.
nvic.h
systick.c     - System Timer.
systick.h
usic_buffer.h - Basic message buffering for the USIC
usic_buffer.c
usic.h        - Universal serial interface channel.
usic.c
