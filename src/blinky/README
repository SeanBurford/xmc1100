Programs that blink the LEDs on the XMC1100 XMC2Go board.
  blinky_cpu.c:           A busy loop.
  blinky_systick.c:       Systick timer IRQ with one systick per second.
  blinky_ccu.c:           Two slices of the capture/compare unit PWM at 0.5Hz.
  blinky_rtc.c:           Per second periodic event interrupts from the RTC.
  blinky_rtc_deepsleep.c: Same as RTC with the CPU in deep sleep and flash off.
  blinky_wdt.c:           Watchdog timer alarm IRQ and WDT reboot.

== Running from flash
The .elf build results (blinky_cpu.elf, etc) run from flash and are loaded/used
from gdb as follows:
(gdb) file blinky/blinky_cpu.elf
(gdb) mon halt
(gdb) mon reset
(gdb) load
(gdb) mon reset
(gdb) mon go (or run if you have breakpoints)

== Running from SRAM
There are also versions of the above that load into and run directly from SRAM.
They have .elf.sram extensions and are loaded/used from gdb as follows:
(gdb) file blinky/blinky_cpu.elf.sram
(gdb) mon halt
(gdb) mon reset
(gdb) load
(gdb) mon reg pc = 0x20000200
Writing register (PC = 0x20000200)
(gdb) mon go
Where 0x20000200 is the address of init().  init() should stay where it is
provided init.o is the first object file provided to ld in the Makefile.
